* Biostatistical computing

** Overview

This repository holds code for reproducing [[https://even4void.github.io/rstats-biostats/][MÃ©thodes biostatistiques]] in various languages, currently R, Stata, Python, Mathematica, LispStat (the original LispStat written by Luke Tierney) and Racket. Planned DSL and general purpose languages include Clojure, Julia, and Haskell.

** What's in the box

Dependencies (external tools, packages, libraries or modules) are listed in the =INSTALL= file. The =Makefile= should run the code, produce a log file as well as figures in PDF or EPS format.

Versions:

- Stata 13.1 MP
- R 4.2.2 Patched (2022-11-10 r83330)
- Python 3.10.6
- xlispstat 3.52.23 (alpha)
- Racket 8.6 [cs]
- Mathematica 13.2 (Home edition)
- Newlisp 10.7.5

** Work in progress

Estimated progress: 10%.

Be aware this is wip and highly subjected to =git push -f=.
